  <p><strong>life:</strong><br>
    *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ<br>
    <em>
    life is crazy,<br>
    not sure where I am going,<br>
    but I am pushing through.<br>
    sometimes I worry you won't like me,<br>
    and if you don't, I won't blame you.<br>
    I just hope you forgive me...<br>
    I will always love you.<br>
  </em>
